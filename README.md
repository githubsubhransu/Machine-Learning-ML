# Diabetes Risk Prediction Analysis

## Summary of My Understanding (Shailesh Singh)

The aim of this analysis is to investigate how machine learning algorithms can be employed to detect diabetes mellitus (DM) in its early stages using the provided dataset. The tasks include:

1. **Data Visualization and Exploration:**
   - Perform a sanity check by printing sample rows.
   - Create visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.
   - Conduct correlational analysis and discuss its effect on feature selection.

2. **Data Pre-processing and Cleaning:**
   - Identify and address missing values, outliers, and skewed data.
   - Apply feature engineering and transformation techniques.
   - Explore feature importance techniques.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets. (80/20)
   - Build and tune Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
   - Justify hyperparameter tuning decisions.

4. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Compare Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models using evaluation metrics.
   - Provide insights into model performance and the reasons for the superior model.
